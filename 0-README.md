# These are the lessons I've taught as an SI Leader (Supplemental Instruction)for Object Oriented Programming (CPSC-121) for FALL 2018 at CSUF.

Each file has a specific lesson behind it. I write only the comments on the whiteboard and allow the students to work through the issues. I provide as much insight as required for the students to complete the tasks. I really try to allow the students to answer all questions prior to stepping in. 

Hope you like what you see and I encourage you to add and edit as you see fit!
